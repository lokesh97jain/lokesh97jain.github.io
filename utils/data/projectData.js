    description: "This project presents a cutting-edge technique for dehazing images through the use of a deep learning model that integrates convolutional layers, residual connections, and concatenation strategies to enhance image clarity and visibility. Built on TensorFlow 2.0, the model is trained using a dataset of both hazy and clear images, showing significant performance improvements over traditional advanced methods.",
